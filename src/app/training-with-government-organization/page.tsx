            {brandName}, through Sunil Group of Education Fashion and Technology Trust (SGEFTT),
            actively works with government organizations and supported schemes to strengthen skill
            development, vocational training and entrepreneurship across India.
          </p>
          <p>
            In a developing economy, general education alone cannot meet the diverse needs of industry
            and self-employment. Government-linked training plays a vital role in preparing youth with
            practical skills, business awareness and employment readiness. Our institute participates
            in such initiatives to ensure training reaches unemployed and underprivileged sections of
            society, especially in rural and semi-urban areas.
